## Exercise 18

Time to take a look at `io-ts`, `https://github.com/gcanti/io-ts`

The reason behind `io-ts` is primarily in doing type-safe encoding and decoding of data.

More recently with it's new API `io-ts` has started embracing structural derivation of typeclasses like `Eq<A>`, `Arbitrary<A>`, `Show<A>` and similar

At the moment `io-ts` contains both `new` and `old` API, the `new` one is considered still experimental but it is expected that `v3` will remove the `old` one (probably in a few months)

We will take a look at both!
