## Exercise 04

Write the function `tupleEither` that when called with `tupleEither(Either<E, A>, Either<E, B>, Either<E, C>, Either<E, D>)` gives you back `Either<E, [A, B, C, D]>` that should work for an arbitrary number of eithers all with the same type `E`.

## Continue

Generalise it to work with variant `E` returning a union of the error type
