## Exercise 08

Module augmentation is a feature used to extend the type definitions of a specific module from another, let's suppose we have:

```ts
// moduleA.ts
export interface A {
  a: number;
}
```

and

```ts
// moduleB.ts
declare module "./moduleA" {
  export interface B {
    b: number;
  }
}
```

if and when the moduleB is loaded the compiler will extend the definitions of moduleA

It is a feature per se in the compiler to support javascript module extensions where one module can patch another, it is important primarily because the feature can also work to extend types already defined like

```ts
// moduleB.ts
declare module "./moduleA" {
  export interface A {
    b: number;
  }
}
```

will extend the interface definition of A.

This feature has been exploited as one of the backbone elements that compose the encoding of HKTs in `fp-ts` and subsequently improved in `@effect-ts`, we will discuss a small intro to the encoding used in `fp-ts` next time in order to give the attendees the ability to easily understand the function signatures in `fp-ts`.
