## Exercise 01

Conditional Types are probably one of the most powerful features TypeScript has to offer, fundamentally with conditional types you can express conditionality based on constraints, for example:

```ts
type isString<A> = A extends string ? true : false;
```

This type will be `true` is `A` is any type that extends `string` and it is false otherwise.

## Never

Discuss never, why it is fundamental?

## Updates

Since typescript 4.1 released last week we can have recursive conditionals!!
