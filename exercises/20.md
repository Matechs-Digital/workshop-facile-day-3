## Exercise 20

Time to look at `monocle-ts`, `https://github.com/gcanti/monocle-ts`

The reason behind `monocle-ts` is the implementation of `Optics` in `typescript`

`Optics` represent a functional way to access/modify/manipulate nested data structures

Like for `io-ts` we have 2 different APIs one `new` and one `old`, this time we will only look closely at the `new` while havina a quick overview of the `old`, reason being it is internally declared "stable" and the `old` one is guaranteed to be deprecated soon.
