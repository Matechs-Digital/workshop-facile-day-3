## Exercise 10

Now that we can encode HKTs we can also start to define the `interfaces` we wanted, those interfaces are called Typeclasses and are a fundamental concept used everywhere in statically typed functional programming.

The reason for typeclasses is to be able to define behaviour on generic type constructors, for example we previously seen combinators like `tupleEither`, `tupleOption` etc

Using typeclasses we can write those functions once! Let's see step by step how!
