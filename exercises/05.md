## Exercise 05

Write the function `tupleReader` that when called with `tupleReader(Reader<R, A>, Reader<R, B>, Reader<R, C>, Reader<R, D>)` gives you back `Reader<R, [A, B, C, D]>` that should work for an arbitrary number of readers all with the same type `R`.

## Continue

Generalise it to work with variant `R` returning an intersection of the input type
