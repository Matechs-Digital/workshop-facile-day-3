## Exercise 09

We will now begin exploration of Higher Kinded Types (HKTs).

The reason behind the need for HKTs is to generalise over types that have the shape of `Option<A>`, `Either<E, A>`, `Reader<R, A>`, etc.

We have seen that each of the above data-types support a set of common functions like `map` & `chain`

We would like to write `interfaces` that describe those operations on a generic type.

In functional languages like `haskell` those types are natively supported, unfortunately this is not the case of `TypeScript`.

At the moment there are effectively 2 ways we can encode HKTs that lay the foundations on the same principles, one encoding, the first that came up, is the one used in `fp-ts` and the one we will explore in details, the other one is possible only with `TS 4.1+` and it is a further abstraction that reduce the verbosity.

Let's write a minimalistic version of the encoding used in `fp-ts` toghether! Follow step by step on your local and stop at any time something is unclear.
