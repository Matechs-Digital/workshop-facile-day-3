## Exercise 21

We have briefly introduced in the last workshop the concept of ADTs as unions of members, one of the many use cases of ADTs is in building eDSLs (Embedded Domain Specific Languages)

eDSLs are an extremely important design principle used in functional programming

The reason is that an eDSL transform one problems detaching the API level from the implementation details

An eDSL can be viewed as fundamentally 2 separated things, one ADT representing the syntax and one or many interpreters that convert the ADT into a concrete implementation

We will start by developing a small eDSL to address the following specification:

```ts
/**
 * EXPRESSIONS
 *
 * Consider an application (such as the spreadsheet example) that needs to
 * calculate values in a user-defined way.
 */

type CalculatedValue = Integer | Add | Subtract | Multiply;

interface Integer {}

/**
 * EXERCISE 1
 *
 * Add an operator that adds two integer expressions, yielding an integer
 * expression.
 */
interface Add {}

/**
 * EXERCISE 2
 *
 * Add an operator that subtracts an integer from another integer expression,
 * yielding an integer expression.
 */
interface Subtract {}

/**
 * EXERCISE 3
 *
 * Add an operator that multiplies two integer expressions, yielding an
 * integer expression.
 */
interface Multiply {}

function calculate(expression: CalculatedValue): number {}
```
