## Exercise 22

Starting from the previous exercise we want to extend it to support different types of expressions not only numeric values such that the calculate function would return the current type of the expression.

In order to do this in a type safe manner we need to simulate a concept that is commonly used in languages like Scala and Haskell

The concept that we will discuss now is the concept of GADTs (Generalized Albegraic Data Types)

In simple terms a GADT is an ADT with a generic parameter that is specified in every member, basically we would need a `CalculatedValue<A>` that is specialized to `CalculatedValue<number>` in case of a numeric expression and that is specialized as `CalculatedValue<string>` in case of a string expression

```ts
/**
 * EXPRESSIONS
 *
 * Consider an application (such as the spreadsheet example) that needs to
 * calculate values in a user-defined way.
 */

type CalculatedValue<A> =
  | Integer<A>
  | String<A>
  | Add<A>
  | Subtract<A>
  | Multiply<A>;

interface Integer<A> {}

interface String<A> {}

/**
 * EXERCISE 1
 *
 * Add an operator that adds two integer expressions, yielding an integer
 * expression.
 */
interface Add<A> {}

/**
 * EXERCISE 2
 *
 * Add an operator that subtracts an integer from another integer expression,
 * yielding an integer expression.
 */
interface Subtract<A> {}

/**
 * EXERCISE 3
 *
 * Add an operator that multiplies two integer expressions, yielding an
 * integer expression.
 */
interface Multiply<A> {}

/**
 * EXERCISE 4
 *
 * Add an operator that concatenates two strings, yielding a string
 * expression.
 */
interface Concat<A> {}

/**
 * EXERCISE 5
 *
 * Add an operator that determines if a string starts with a specified
 * prefix, yielding a boolean expression.
 */
interface StartsWith<A> {}

function calculate<A>(expression: CalculatedValue<A>): A {}
```
